# discord-emoji-steal

Sick of having to download emojis all day long to add to your server? Do you wish there was an easier way?? 

Not to worry! I have made an emoji steal command, which will steal emojis from other servers so you dont have to have a 5gb download full of images where your setting all the emojis up. 

This Command is for V13 only, as I will only provide V13, but it can be changed to v12 if you are still running v13.

`Is this a bad way to do it?`
No, not necessarily, as alot of the emojis like pepe for example, are not owned by the server you are stealing emojis from, but be careful as some emojis may have been made by the server your stealing from, which can get you in big trouble!

IF you get in trouble for using this command, I am not responsible. Please use this command appropriately, and only take whats necessary, and what is "publicly allowed".
